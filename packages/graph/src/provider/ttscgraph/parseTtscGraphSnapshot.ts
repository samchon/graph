/**
 * Validate one `ttscgraph serve` frame into {@link ITtscGraphSnapshot}.
 *
 * The version is read before the shape, because a producer speaking another
 * protocol is entitled to another shape. Checking the shape first would report
 * a version mismatch as a field complaint — "response.mode must be one of …" —
 * about a contract the other side never agreed to, which is the misparse the
 * version field exists to prevent. Ask which protocol it is, then hold it to
 * that protocol.
 *
 * Every field the client later branches on is checked here, not cast. The
 * envelope used to be a bare cast whose `mode` was typed `string | undefined`
 * and defaulted to `""`, so the one field that says whether the compiler reused
 * its program or rebuilt it could be absent, wrong, or invented without anybody
 * noticing — and it was, on the error path, where the old producer's
 * `omitempty` dropped it.
