/**
 * The serve stream is NDJSON, and the client owns the framing. A frame the OS
 * hands over in two chunks, or one preceded by a blank line, must reassemble
 * into exactly the same snapshot as a frame delivered whole — the transport
 * must never leak into the facts.
 *
 * The confirmation round-trip this file once also covered is gone: the client
 * no longer re-reads disk or issues a second poll to confirm a dump still holds
 * (the producer's manifest answers that in the same envelope), so there is no
 * "concurrent edit during confirmation" path left to drive. What survives #70's
 * rewrite is the framing invariant, and that is what this test now states.
