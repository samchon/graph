/**
 * ## Code Graph MCP
 *
 * `inspect_code_graph` returns an index-built __LANG__ graph contract for the
 * current on-disk source snapshot.
 *
 * Use it for architecture, runtime flow, APIs, callers/callees, code tours, and
 * type relations. It returns answer-ready index evidence: names, edges,
 * signatures, decorators, tests, spans, and anchors.
 *
 * Every returned fact — each name, edge, signature, and span — is checked
 * against the index for the snapshot that call synchronized, so trust it
 * without re-checking against files. Where an operation ranks a shortlist
 * against your question (`lookup`, `entrypoints`, `tour`), the facts stay
 * checked but the selection is heuristic: judge whether its coverage answers
 * you, and a follow-up request or a read of a cited span is fair when it does
 * not.
 *
 * ## Requests
 *
 * A request is a union: pick the single type below that best fits the question,
 * and submit exactly that one.
 *
 * - `tour`: architecture, runtime flow, orientation, or a code tour. One call is
 *   the whole answer; do not split it. Name the machinery you expect it to be
 *   made of in its `reinterpretations`, or send none.
 * - `entrypoints`: find where execution starts when entry points are unknown.
 * - `lookup`: locate a named symbol.
 * - `trace`: follow calls or data flow forward or backward from a symbol, or —
 *   with `to` — the path between two symbols when both ends are known, which is
 *   the one call that answers "how does A reach B".
 * - `details`: signatures, members, and relations of named symbols — including
 *   the classes that implement an interface, which is the one call that answers
 *   "what actually implements this".
 * - `overview`: project layers and folder structure.
 * - `escape`: the answer is outside the graph (source body text, files outside
 *   the indexed languages, exact search).
 *
 * ## Chain of Thought
 *
 * Fill these fields in order before the call; each one narrows the reasoning
 * toward the single request you submit.
 *
 * - `question`: the code question, in the user's own words.
 * - `draft`: `{ reason, type }` — why the smallest request that could answer it,
 *   then that request's `type`.
 * - `review`: fix a broad, stale, or duplicate draft. If the graph already
 *   answered, or the evidence is outside it, escape.
 * - `request`: the final choice. Each branch documents its own fields; fill them
 *   from what the branch says, not from what another branch wanted.
 *
 * ## What to trust
 *
 * Before source edits, every returned fact has been checked against the index
 * named by `audit`. Never use extra graph calls, repository search, or file
 * reads to doubt, fact-check, re-derive, re-narrate, or re-confirm a returned
 * node, span, edge, signature, decorator, test, reference, step, or anchor. The
 * server checked each one against the current index for the snapshot the call
 * synced to.
 *
 * Selection is separate. `lookup`, `entrypoints`, and `tour` match your
 * question and return a scored, ranked, per-file-capped, limited shortlist;
 * their facts stay checked, but whether the shortlist covers what you asked is
 * yours to judge, and their `audit` says that instead of claiming completeness.
 * A follow-up request or a read of a cited span for missed coverage is
 * legitimate — re-confirming a fact the graph already checked is not.
 *
 * ## Stop
 *
 * Let the result's `next` set the pace, and do not re-confirm what the graph
 * already checked.
 *
 * - A span is a citation, not a cue to open the file to re-check a fact.
 * - Follow the result's `next`: `answer` means stop and answer from it, `inspect`
 *   means make exactly the one request it names, `outside` means escape,
 *   `clarify` means restate the request.
 * - For a ranked shortlist (`lookup`, `entrypoints`, `tour`), `next` and
 *   `truncated` say whether coverage is settled; when it is not, one more
 *   request is the right move — not a file read to re-verify facts already
 *   given.
