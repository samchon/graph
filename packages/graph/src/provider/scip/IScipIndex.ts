/**
 * The SCIP index as `scip print --json` writes it.
 *
 * SCIP is a whole-workspace semantic artifact that a language's own indexer
 * produces once, so consuming it is strictly better than re-asking a language
 * server the same questions file by file. What it is *not* is a graph: the
 * common schema records where a symbol is defined, referenced, read, and
 * written, and which symbols it implements or is typed by — and stops. It has
 * no universal way to say that a reference is an invocation rather than a
 * function value, that a type reference is a construction, or what a decorator
 * means, because those distinctions are not the same fact in every language.
 *
 * So this contract is deliberately narrow. Everything it can prove is mapped;
 * everything else is left to a typed, per-language enrichment, and nothing is
 * inferred from source punctuation. A `(` after a name is not evidence of a
 * call — it is evidence of a `(`.
 *
 * Field names follow protobuf's JSON mapping (lowerCamelCase), which is what
 * the `scip` CLI emits. Enums arrive as their names, not their numbers, except
 * {@link IOccurrence.symbolRoles}, which is a bitmask and stays numeric.
