/**
 * The executable definition of "this product is a faithful multi-language
 * reproduction of `ITtscGraphApplication`".
 *
 * The product began as a port of the TypeScript-only `@ttsc/graph`. That origin
 * is a contract, not history: the MCP request/result union, the
 * question/draft/review/request workflow, and the audit/next/result output shape
 * must stay structurally identical to the reference, while only the fact-
 * production layer underneath is free to change. Hand comparison cannot hold
 * that line — source, schema, unions, requiredness, and nesting drift
 * independently and silently.
 *
 * The gate is a rewrite, not a diff. Every difference between the reference and
 * this product must be spelled out as a named, reviewed rule; applying those
 * rules to the reference must reproduce this product's contract *exactly*. An
 * exact match means every difference is accounted for. Anything else — a field
 * added here, a union member dropped there, an unreviewed edit, or drift in the
 * reference itself — fails closed, because no rule explains it.
 *
 * The two fidelities stay separate. {@link normalize} strips comments for the
 * structural gate so wording cannot mask a shape change, while the prose gate
 * keeps JSDoc and defaults and applies only explicitly prose-scoped rules.
