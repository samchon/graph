/**
 * Build the MCP server for a graph.
 *
 * `typia.llm.application` reflects {@link ISamchonGraphApplication} into the
 * tool's input and output schemas and its argument validator, with no
 * hand-written schema: the interface's JSDoc becomes the handshake
 * instructions, the method's becomes the tool description, and every property's
 * becomes the description of that field — including `audit`, whose JSDoc is how
 * a caller learns what the server checked before it answered.
 *
 * The result ships once. Below `@typia/mcp` 13.1.0 a tool that declares an
 * output schema answered with `structuredContent` *and* the same JSON
 * serialized into a text block: the payload crossed the wire twice, a client
 * counted both copies against its tool-result cap, and a 30 KB tour arrived as
 * 60 KB, blew the cap, and was spilled to a file the model then shelled out to
 * read back. From 13.1.0 the structured result is the only copy (§4j), and the
 * text fallback is an opt-in this server does not take.
