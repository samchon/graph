/**
 * The faults a live serve stream can inflict that the envelope parser never
 * sees.
 *
 * Every malformed *envelope* — a non-object, a missing id, a wrong-typed field,
 * a changed frame with no dump — is now proved directly against the parser in
 * `test_ttscgraph_serve_envelope_is_validated_before_it_is_routed`, which can
 * feed it frames a fake server emitting one shape per process cannot. What only
 * a live stream can produce, and so is proved here, is the client's own reaction
 * to conditions the parser is never handed: a line that is not JSON at all, a
 * well-formed frame routed to an id nobody awaits, and a first answer that
 * claims an unchanged snapshot when none has been published yet. Each must fail
 * the refresh loudly and leave the client with no snapshot and generation zero —
 * never a silently empty success.
