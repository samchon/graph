# Solo Campaign Development

Read this document in full when the user authorizes implementation pull requests
or ends a solo issue campaign that entered implementation. Also read the
development, pull-request, and review skills before acting.

## Flow

- [Plan One Cycle Pull Request](#plan-one-cycle-pull-request)
- [Claim The Complete Cycle](#claim-the-complete-cycle)
- [Implement And Write Tests](#implement-and-write-tests)
- [Validate With CI And Self-Review](#validate-with-ci-and-self-review)
- [Merge And Clean Up](#merge-and-clean-up)
- [Repeat Until A Clean Round](#repeat-until-a-clean-round)

Four rules govern implementation:

- The main agent performs all implementation, test authoring, CI diagnosis,
  review, and cleanup. Do not spawn or delegate to a subagent.
- Put every accepted, implementation-ready issue in the current cycle into one
  pull request. The issue DAG controls edit order inside that pull request, not
  pull-request count.
- Use the current checkout and one topic branch. Do not create a clone or
  worktree for a solo campaign or its Self-Review.
- Every ordinary pull-request check is evidence. Do not cancel a campaign run,
  and repair every red CI lane in the same pull request even when it predates
  the campaign or is unrelated to its original issues.

## Plan One Cycle Pull Request

Recompute the published-issue dependency DAG after publication. Record
dependencies because they determine safe edit order and when one fix can expose
another, but do not partition ready issues into separate pull requests.

Build the cycle scope in this order:

1. Reopen every published, unclaimed issue and verify it still belongs to this
   repository and campaign.
2. Remove only issues proved duplicate, invalid, out of scope, or externally
   blocked, and record the exact disposition. An accepted unresolved issue
   prevents campaign completion.
3. Check open pull requests and remote branches for overlapping work before
   claiming.
4. Put every remaining issue into one cycle ledger with its acceptance matrix,
   consequence surface, affected files, and DAG predecessors.
5. Record the issue count before grouping and the result as one pull-request
   unit.

Different packages, invariants, or validation lanes do not split the solo
cycle. Keep issue-level commits when that improves diagnosis, but the pull
request remains the integrated campaign unit.

An issue whose only predecessor is another issue in the same cycle is
implementation-ready for this purpose. Order the edits through the DAG instead
of deferring it to another pull request.

## Claim The Complete Cycle

Claim the whole cycle before implementation:

1. Use the current clean repository checkout, switch to the target branch,
   update it with `git pull --ff-only`, and create one topic branch. Do not
   create a clone or worktree for a solo campaign.
2. Create one implementation-free commit with `git commit --allow-empty`.
3. Push the branch and open one draft pull request.
4. Link every cycle issue, mark verification pending, and state that the pull
   request owns the complete accepted cycle.
5. Record the checkout, branch, pull request, head SHA, issue set, and
   assignment-created temporary-asset ledger in `.wiki`.

The empty pull request prevents overlapping contributor work before code is
written. Measure official duration from its GitHub `createdAt` timestamp through
`mergedAt`, including implementation, CI, review, fixes, rebases, and merge.

## Implement And Write Tests

Work through the DAG on the claimed topic branch. Analyze the full consequence
and case surface across every issue before editing, then implement the complete
cycle and its tests.

Each issue remains an evidence and acceptance unit inside the combined diff.
Keep its positive, negative, boundary, and regression cases identifiable.
Near-100 percent coverage of changed behavior is required; a green happy path
is not completion.

Follow the development and project skills' narrow-to-broad validation rules.
This repository has no repository-wide formatter command; do not invent one.
Run only the local commands the consequence surface requires, then record every
unavailable external check honestly.

If implementation disproves, narrows, or externally blocks an issue, reopen the
evidence and update the issue and campaign ledger before changing the claimed
scope. Do not leave an orphan issue or pretend an unresolved accepted issue was
completed.

## Validate With CI And Self-Review

Commit and push the integrated snapshot, then let every ordinary pull-request
check run. Start solo Self-Review immediately over that exact base-to-head diff
while CI executes.

CI and review are independent gates:

- CI must prove every configured build, test, coverage, packaging, platform,
  and applicable real-language-server lane.
- Self-Review must prove requirement fidelity, consequence coverage,
  issue-by-issue acceptance, test quality, documentation, generated output,
  and risks not encoded in CI.

When either gate finds a defect:

1. Diagnose the real cause from the CI log or review evidence.
2. Correct the source and complete the corresponding regression coverage.
3. Run the local validation required by the development skill.
4. Commit and push the correction.
5. Let the new CI run to completion and restart Self-Review as a fresh complete
   round over the new head.

Fix every red CI lane in the same pull request even when the failure predates the
campaign or is unrelated to the campaign's original issues. Commit and push the
repair instead of dismissing it as another contributor's failure.

Do not merge a head whose green checks belong to an older SHA or whose clean
review predates a correction. Continue the loop until the same immutable head
has green required checks and a complete Self-Review round with no sound
improvement.

## Merge And Clean Up

Merge only with user authorization, including a campaign-local standing
authorization that explicitly covers merge.

After merge:

1. Verify GitHub records the pull request as merged into the intended target and
   every linked issue has the correct final state.
2. Confirm the checkout has no unpushed or uncommitted work worth preserving.
3. Switch back to the target branch, pull with `git pull --ff-only`, and delete
   the local topic branch.
4. For every assignment-created external path, confirm no live process or other
   assignment uses it, preserve required evidence, delete only the exact proven
   path, and verify it is absent.
5. Never bulk-delete a shared temporary directory, global `GOCACHE`,
   `GOMODCACHE`, an installed Go toolchain, or an asset whose ownership is
   uncertain.

## Repeat Until A Clean Round

After every merged cycle, return to the parent skill's Discover Issues phase and
perform another complete fresh round over the entire declared scope.

If any meaningful candidate survives fact-checking, adjudicate and publish it
when authorized, then claim the next single cycle pull request containing every
implementation-ready issue. Repeat discovery, implementation, CI, review,
merge, and cleanup without a fixed round limit.

The campaign succeeds only when all of these are true:

- one complete fresh full-scope discovery round produces no meaningful candidate
  after fact-checking;
- no accepted or published campaign issue remains unresolved;
- no campaign pull request, branch, process, or assignment-owned temporary
  asset remains; and
- the target checkout is clean and synchronized.

If an external blocker makes those conditions impossible, report the campaign as
blocked rather than complete.
