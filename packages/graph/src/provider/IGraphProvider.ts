/**
 * One registered strict provider: which languages it owns, how it is found on
 * a given project, and how a session is opened against it.
 *
 * The indexer used to decide this inline. `buildLspGraph` asked
 * `language === "typescript"`, resolved `ttscgraph`, and constructed a
 * `TtscGraphClient` in the middle of its language loop. Adding a second
 * provider that way adds a second branch, and a fifteenth adds a fifteenth:
 * the loop becomes the registry, except that nothing can enumerate it, no test
 * can ask it what it supports, and the audit prose that calls every semantic
 * fact a "language server" fact has no way to learn that a compiler produced
 * this one.
 *
 * So a provider states its own terms. It says which languages it owns, what
 * its facts are grounded in, whether it can honour the caller's options at
 * all, where its executable lives, and what preparation the project needs
 * before it will answer. The indexer's job shrinks to asking, in order, and
 * reporting what it was told.
