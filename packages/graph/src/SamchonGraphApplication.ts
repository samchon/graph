/**
 * The MCP tool surface as a plain class over the resident
 * {@link SamchonGraphMemory}.
 *
 * Its public method is the MCP tool: `typia.llm.application` reflects
 * {@link ISamchonGraphApplication} to generate the tool's JSON schema and
 * argument validator from the signature and JSDoc, with no hand-written schema,
 * and `@typia/mcp`'s `createMcpServer` registers it (see `./mcp/createServer`).
 * The method delegates to the pure graph functions in `./operations`, which are
 * unit-testable without a transport; this class only binds them to the graph.
 *
 * Every method answers from the current resident graph. The source may refresh
 * that graph before the operation when project files changed. Output is kept
 * compact and bounded so a model can read structure without a file read, which
 * is the token win the redesign exists for.
