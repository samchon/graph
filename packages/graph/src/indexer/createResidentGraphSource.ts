 * What every source file on disk contains right now, as a content hash per file.
 *
 * The audit that rides on every result says the facts were resolved "for the
 * snapshot this call synced to", and that sentence is only true if the server
 * can actually tell that the snapshot moved. A timestamp cannot: a same-tick
 * edit — an editor writing a file twice inside one clock resolution, a script
 * rewriting a file to the same length — leaves the mtime where it was, and the
 * graph then answers a question about code that no longer exists while swearing
 * it is current (§1c).
 *
 * So freshness is the file's content, hashed, and nothing else. It costs one
 * read of each source file per call, which is what the walk already pays, and it
 * cannot be wrong.
