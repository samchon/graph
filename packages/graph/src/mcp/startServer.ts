/**
 * Serve the graph tools over MCP on stdio. The server answers the MCP handshake
 * immediately and opens the resident incremental graph session on the first real
 * tool call, so a large project cannot make the client give up before tools are
 * advertised and an escape request still performs no graph work.
 *
 * That is not a nicety. A host may lazy-load a tool's schema behind a search
 * step (§4b), so a server that is still `pending` at session init is a server
 * the model starts its turn *without* — it shells out to `grep` and `find`
 * instead, and every extra call re-sends the whole context. The tool that exists
 * to cut the context bill is then absent from the turn that runs it up.

  // dump itself, or from a cheap file-extension scan that doesn't need a live
  // LSP session — so the tool description can name the language a session
  // actually indexes instead of staying generic. Neither reads a graph.
