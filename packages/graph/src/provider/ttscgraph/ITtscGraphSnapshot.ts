 * `packages/ttsc/cmd/ttscgraph/serve.go`, first published at tag `v0.19.2`
 * (`77192d97a`). There is no generator between the Go struct and this file, and
 * there cannot be one this repository owns: the producer lives in another
 * repository and ships as a prebuilt binary whose version the target project —
 * not this package — chooses. That is why {@link ITtscGraphSnapshot.PROTOCOL_VERSION}
 * exists, and why {@link parseTtscGraphSnapshot} validates every field on
 * arrival instead of casting.
 *
 * This is the envelope only. The `dump` it carries stays `unknown` here on
 * purpose: {@link adaptTtscGraphDump} validates the body field by field into
 * the product's own structures, so restating the body's wire shape would add a
 * second contract to keep in sync with the same Go struct — and it would be the
 * one the adapter never consults, which is the kind of duplicate that goes
 * stale without anything failing.
