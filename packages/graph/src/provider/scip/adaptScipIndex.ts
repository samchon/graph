/**
 * The edge families a bare SCIP index can prove.
 *
 * Short on purpose. SCIP records where a symbol is defined, referenced, read,
 * and written, and which symbols it implements or is typed by. It does not
 * universally distinguish an invocation from a function value, a construction
 * from a type reference, or say what an annotation means — those are different
 * facts in different languages, and the schema has no common field for them.
 *
 * So `calls`, `instantiates`, `overrides`, `decorates`, and `tests` are absent
 * here and stay absent unless a language enrichment proves them. The
 * alternative — reading the source at the occurrence and looking for a `(` —
 * is not a weaker version of proving a call; it is a different thing wearing
 * its name, and it is wrong on every function value, every macro, and every
 * language whose call syntax is not juxtaposition with parentheses.
 *
 * Roles and implementation relationships are intentionally not promoted here.
 * They are fields in the interchange, but their producer semantics are not
 * uniform: stock Go labels every reference as a read (including writes, calls,
 * and imports), PHP labels every reference with role zero, and some producers
 * emit transitive implementation closure where others emit direct parents.
 * A language provider must opt into those mappings after proving its own
 * producer contract; the common adapter can prove only the reference itself.
