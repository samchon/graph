/**
 * The whole-graph export `samchon-graph dump` writes and the MCP server loads —
 * the wire contract between the indexer and the code graph engine.
 *
 * It is the complete graph with none of the per-response caps the MCP tools
 * apply: every node and edge the build resolved. The server parses each changed
 * snapshot (typia-validated) into an in-memory resident graph and reuses that
 * warm model while project inputs stay unchanged.
 *
 * It is a pure function of its source: two dumps of the same unedited checkout
 * are byte-identical, so a graph can be cached, diffed, and trusted. Nothing
 * here records when it was built — a timestamp would move under an unchanged
 * source, which is exactly the property a cache and a diff depend on.
 *
 * `project` is the producer-local absolute locator. Every identity-bearing path
 * uses one schema-v6 coordinate relative to it: project files are ordinary
 * relative paths; same-filesystem siblings use `../` segments; package files
 * keep their full resolution context (including version/peer-store segments);
 * and a virtual compiler source stays `bundled:///…`. Raw absolute identities
 * are never emitted. A source on another drive or UNC share makes the producer
 * fail unless a future contract supplies a logical root for it. The same
 * coordinate flows through nodes, edges, evidence, diagnostics, and results.
