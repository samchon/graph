// Cross-language benchmark corpus. The `dedicated` questions live in
// questions/<name>.md, taken verbatim from codegraph's evaluation suite
// (.claude/skills/agent-eval/corpus.json) and pinned by SHA-256 in
// questions/manifest.json (regenerate with graph/generate-manifest.mjs). The
// shared `common` onboarding question (questions/common.md) is asked against
// every repo.
//
// Coverage standard is codegraph's own: every supported language that appears
// in its suite is here, one repo each — 13 of the 17 registered languages.
// scala, zig, and bash are deliberately absent: codegraph has no dedicated
// utterance for them, and inventing one would break prompt provenance. swift
// (Alamofire) is absent too: this host has no Swift toolchain, sourcekit-lsp
// ships only with the multi-GB Swift-for-Windows install, and an Apple-centric
// SwiftPM build is not guaranteed to index cleanly here.
//
// Each entry pins the exact `commit` measured (recorded 2026-07-08 from each
// repo's HEAD) so runs stay reproducible while upstreams move. The graph is
// never capped: no file limit, no reference limit, and no LSP timeout — a slow
// but correct language-server index is always waited out in full rather than
// truncated. `prepare` runs a one-off shell command in the checkout before
// indexing when a server needs it.
