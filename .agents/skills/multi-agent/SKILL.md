name: multi-agent
description: Defines the explicitly parallel @samchon/graph variants of review and issue campaigns. Use only when the user explicitly requests a team, parallel, or multi-agent review or issue campaign. Route review work to review.md and issue campaigns to issue-campaign.md. Self-Review, unqualified review, and a campaign without explicit parallel authorization remain solo.

# Multi-Agent Workflows

This skill is the single entry point for every explicitly parallel review or
issue campaign. Read the base solo skill first, then enter through the detailed
document below for the requested workflow.

| Explicit request | Base skill | Detailed multi-agent procedure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Team, parallel, or multi-agent review | [review](../review/SKILL.md) | [review.md](review.md) |
| Parallel or multi-agent issue campaign | [issue-campaign](../issue-campaign/SKILL.md) | [issue-campaign.md](issue-campaign.md) |

This repository has a benchmark runner, not a benchmark-campaign workflow. The
[benchmark skill](../benchmark/SKILL.md) continues to govern its measurements;
do not invent a parallel benchmark-campaign variant.

Do not load this skill for Self-Review, an unqualified review, or a campaign
that does not explicitly request parallel agents.

## Shared Parallelism Rules

- Use the smallest number of agents that adds independent evidence or owns
  immediately executable disjoint work. Available thread capacity is not a
  reason to create an agent.
- Never create a waiter, poller, coordinator-only child, duplicate
  implementation owner, or agent that cannot begin useful work immediately.
- Give every review or discovery agent the complete declared surface. Parallel
  review adds independent full passes; it never partitions coverage by package,
  file, concern, platform, or test lane.
- Partition implementation only through verified dependency and file-ownership
  boundaries. One agent owns one coarse batch, branch, pull request, and
  worktree.
- Keep the lead active on fact-checking, integration, conflict resolution, and
  decisions that do not duplicate an assigned agent.
- Do not let agents re-delegate.
- Self-Review remains solo for every author and every implementation branch.
- Create worktrees only for parallel implementation batches and their integrated
  cleanup. Solo implementation uses the current checkout and one topic branch.
- Remove every finished worktree, local branch, process, and assignment-owned
  temporary asset before declaring its assignment complete.

The user's phase boundary controls the topology. A multi-agent issue campaign
uses parallel discovery and parallel implementation by default. Switch only its
implementation to the solo workflow when the user explicitly requests parallel
discovery with solo implementation.
