/**
 * Every registered strict provider, in selection order.
 *
 * This list is the registry. Discovery reads it; nothing else decides which
 * providers exist, and adding one is an entry here rather than a branch in the
 * indexer. Order is the tie-break when two entries could serve the same
 * language, and it is deterministic so a build's provider choice does not
 * depend on iteration accident.
 *
 * Two entries claiming the same language for one project is a registry defect,
 * not a runtime condition: {@link selectGraphProviders} refuses the build
 * rather than silently letting the earlier entry win, because a graph whose
 * facts came from an arbitrary one of two compilers is not a graph anyone can
 * reason about.
