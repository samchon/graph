// The canonical graph data model and tool I/O types: the wire contract
// `samchon-graph dump` emits and the MCP server loads, plus the schemas typia
// derives the tool surface from. Pure types so typia can build validators and
// tool schemas at build time, and so every indexer — language server or static
// parser — has one source of truth to produce against.
